Q1

I model each state in game.py as class Game.
After that I write class named search tree.
This tree of the all state.
However tree expand if it need. I use lazy loading.

Q2.

In this part I use iterative BFS algorthm.
I write class for it that I inheret from searchtree class.

Q3.

In last part I implement AStar algorthm.
I write class for it and This class is inhered from IBFS.
I use same algorthm before but this time,
it only discover path advised from heuristic and cost function.
Thus, there is huge difference between running time.

For 3 lamb and wolf:
IBFS algorthm's running time is 0.010346
AStar algorthm's running time is 0.000975

For 15 lamb and wolf:
IBFS algorthm's running time is 7.889210
A* algorthm's running time is 0.031287


This result show that A* with using heuristic performans better then IBFS.
